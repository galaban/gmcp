# gmcp
Galaban's GMCP plugin

This plugin pulls in the extra data sent to the clieint and allows you to view it.  It was written for the Aardwolf mud and is a plugin for the MuschClient.


Usage:

gmcp room:          Show the GMCP room data.

gmcp exits:         View the standard 'exits' output with room ids

Setup:

gmcp autoid:        Enable/Disable the room id when viewing the room.

gmcp color <color>: Change the color of the GMCP output.

Setup:

Make sure that this is installed in the Musclient's plugin directory, as it relies on the aardwolf_colors.lua script, which resides in the directory.
